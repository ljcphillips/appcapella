# AppCapella

Our Final Project at Makers Academy! Our goal is to create a web application that allows the user to record multiple videos with sound and be able to play them at the same time, layering the recordings to produce a unique acapella-like song.

## Getting Started
To run the program, clone this repo into your local computer:
`git clone https://github.com/ljcphillips/appcapella.git`

This app uses the testing gems `rspec` for feature tests, `simplecov` for test coverage, and `rubocop` for code quality. The gem `shotgun` is used to run the web app on the browser, as well as other gems needed to create the webpages.

To install the required gems in the terminal:
```
bundle install
```

## Usage
To start the app: `rackup`

Navigate to `?`

## User Stories
```

So that I can listen & watch recordings
I want to be able to play the videos
```
```
